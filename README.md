# Skyforge Build Configuration Tool (BCT)  

BCT is a C#-based generator for Visual Studio and FastBuild projects that supports C++, C#, and also Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows platforms.  
It is very similar to https://github.com/ubisoft/Sharpmake, but it was written before Ubisoft open-sourced Sharpmake.
